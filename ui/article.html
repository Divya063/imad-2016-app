Our old cell phones had around 15 buttons . Not enough for us fussy people. We wanted a full Qwerty keyboard.And when we got that,we changed our minds again.We didn't want any buttons at all.Now,with touchscreens becoming a mainstay,some of us are missing the tactile feel of.... yes,you guessed right buttons!</div>
       <div> Thanks to graphics designer Boaz Mendel and the application developer Nimrod Black ,you now have the Pressy.Dubbed the Almighty Android Button,it connects to your smartphone via the 3.5mm headphone jack
And you can customize it via the free pressy app to perform your most used everyday actions.For example-you could use it as a shutter release button for your camera.</div>
        There'll be just one question that'll vex you when you use it: Where the heck do you connect your earphones?Hah! Don't ask me.You wanted that extra button :-)
